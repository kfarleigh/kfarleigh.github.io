     excerpt: 'The effects of climate and demographic history in shaping genomic variation across populations of the Desert Horned Lizard (_Phrynosoma platyrhinos_). 2021. *__Molecular Ecology__* <br><br> 
     Species often experience spatial environmental heterogeneity across their range, and populations may exhibit signatures of adaptation to local environmental characteristics. 
     Other population genetic processes, such as migration and genetic drift, can impede the effects of local adaptation. Genetic drift in particular 
     can have a pronounced effect on population genetic structure during large-scale geographic expansions, where a series of founder effects leads to 
     decreases in genetic variation in the direction of the expansion. Here, we explore the genetic diversity of a desert lizard that occupies a wide range 
     of environmental conditions and that has experienced post-glacial expansion northwards along two colonization routes. Based on our analyses of a 
     large SNP data set, we find evidence that both climate and demographic history have shaped the genetic structure of populations. 
     Pronounced genetic differentiation was evident between populations occupying cold versus hot deserts, and we detected numerous loci with significant 
     associations with climate. The genetic signal of founder effects, however, is still present in the genomes of the recently expanded populations, 
     which comprise subsets of genetic variation found in the southern populations.'
