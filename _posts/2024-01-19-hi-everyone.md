## Who am I?
Hi, everyone; my name is Keaka Farleigh. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Global Change Biology Lab](https://caloprymnus.com/) at Miami University (OH). I use bioinformatics
and data science to investigate the mechanisms that influence genetic variation. I have been fortunate to work on projects (see my [Research](https://kfarleigh.github.io/research/) or [Publications](https://kfarleigh.github.io/publications/) pages) that cover a variety of topics and organisms. I have R, Python, ArcGIS, shell scripting, and statistics expertise. I am always looking to collaborate and expand my skillset, so reach out if you'd like to talk about anything. 
## Goal of this Blog
I will use this blog to discuss topics relevant to bioinformatics, genetics, and data science. I will also announce any news regarding my career or life in general. Posts will be short overviews of topics with example code (if applicable). My [book](https://kfarleigh.github.io/ResearchersGuideToPopulationGenomics/) will contain more detailed information and examples. I plan to post articles monthly beginning in March.
