## Who am I?
Hi everyone, my name is Keaka Farleigh. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Global Change Biology Lab](https://caloprymnus.com/) at Miami University (OH). I use bioinformatics
and data science to investigate the mechanisms that influence genetic variation. I have been fortunate to work projects (see my [Research](https://kfarleigh.github.io/research/) or [Publications](https://kfarleigh.github.io/publications/) pages) that cover a variety of topics and organisms. I have expertise in R, Python, ArcGIS, shell scripting, and statistics. I am always looking to collaborate and expand my skillset so reach out if you'd like to talk about anything. 

## Goal of this Blog
I will use this blog to announce any news regarding my career or life in general. The posts should be short, but I expect them to vary according to the topic.
