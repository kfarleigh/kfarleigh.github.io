## Who am I?
Hi everyone, my name is Keaka Farleigh. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Global Change Biology Lab](https://caloprymnus.com/) at Miami University (OH). I use bioinformatics
and data science to investigate the mechanisms that influence genetic variation. I have been fortunate to work on projects (see my [Research](https://kfarleigh.github.io/research/) or [Publications](https://kfarleigh.github.io/publications/) pages) that cover a variety of topics and organisms. I have expertise in R, Python, ArcGIS, shell scripting, and statistics. I am always looking to collaborate and expand my skillset so reach out if you'd like to talk about anything. 

## Goal of this Blog
I will use this blog to discuss topis relevant to bioinformatics and data science. I will also announce any news regarding my career or life in general. Posts will be short overviews of topics with example code. My [book](https://kfarleigh.github.io/book/) will contain more detailed information and examples.
