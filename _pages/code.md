[PopGenHelpR](https://kfarleigh.github.io/PopGenHelpR/){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

An R package to estimate commonly used population genomic statistics and to generate publication quality figures. 

[HybridFindR](https://github.com/kfarleigh/HybridFindR){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

An R package to detect signals of differential introgression in hybrid individuals. Published in [Farleigh et al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.17170).

## Scripts and Workshop Code 

[GEApermutation](https://github.com/kfarleigh/GEApermutation){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}<img src="/images/R_logo.png"  width="50px" height="50px">

Code to perform a statistical test to identify differential signals of local adaptation. 

[AnolisSims](https://github.com/kfarleigh/AnolisSims){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}<img src="/images/Bash_py.png"  width="250px" height="225px">

Scripts to automate demographic simulations in msprime. Scripts were developed to generate a null distribution to test for signals of differential introgression and were published in [Farleigh et al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.17170).

[Moments](https://github.com/kfarleigh/Moments){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}<img src="/images/Python_logo.png"  width="250px" height="225px">

Python scripts and demographic models used to model the demographic history of 3 and 4 populations. These models were originally published in [Farleigh et al. (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.16070).
