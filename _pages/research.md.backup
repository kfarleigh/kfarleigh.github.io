I seek to understand how environmental conditions, phenotypes (observable traits), and genotypes are linked. Generally, my research aims to answer the following questions:
	
1. *How do populations of species exist in areas with different environments? How do they respond when those environments change?*

2. *What is the genetic architecture of traits and disorders? How are genotypes linked to phenotypes, and how do environmental conditions influence these links?* 

3. *Can we use bioinformatics approaches to develop novel techniques and increase the efficiency of present software to address questions 1 and 2?*
