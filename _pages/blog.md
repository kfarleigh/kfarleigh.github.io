I am slowly developing a blog/book that covers topics in population genetics/genomics and bioinformatics with empirical data and worked examples. Feel free to [reach out](https://kfarleigh.github.io/contact/) if you are interested. I will post the link to the book once I have drafted a few chapters, but am prioritizing my dissertationa and working on this in my theoretical free time.
